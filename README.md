# Ping Pong Game Clone

A simple 2D Ping Pong game replica built using the Unity game engine and C#. This project was developed as part of a game development bootcamp, applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage game logic, collision detection, and game physics. The game replicates the classic retro Ping Pong with added modern features.

## Features
- **Two-player mode:** Play against another person locally.
- **Retro-inspired design:** Simple and clean graphics inspired by the original Pong game.
- **Collision detection:** Accurate ball and paddle interaction using Unity's physics engine.
- **Score tracking:** Real-time score updates for both players.

## Technologies Used
- **Game Engine:** Unity
- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Applied to structure game logic, manage entities, and handle player and ball interactions.

## Installation & Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pingpong-replica.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Unity:
    - Open Unity Hub and click on "Open Project."
    - Select the cloned project folder and open it in Unity.
3. Press the **Play** button in Unity to run the game in the editor or build the game for your platform (PC, Mac, etc.).

## Gameplay Instructions
1. Player 1 controls their paddle using the **W** (up) and **S** (down) keys.
2. Player 2 (or AI) uses the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to move their paddle.
3. The first player to reach a score of **10** wins the game.

## OOP Principles Applied
- **Encapsulation:** Game objects like paddles and the ball are managed as separate classes, encapsulating their properties and behaviors.
- **Inheritance:** Shared behaviors such as movement and collision handling are managed through base classes, allowing reuse across game entities.
- **Polymorphism:** Different types of game objects (e.g., AI paddle vs. Player paddle) share common functionality but behave differently based on input or AI logic.
- **Abstraction:** Simplified interactions like player input and collision handling are hidden from the main game loop, allowing for cleaner, more maintainable code.

## Future Improvements
- Add sound effects and background music.
- Implement different difficulty levels for the AI opponent.
- Add online multiplayer functionality.
